# Help me to be 'Lazy' [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rytotul/iAmLazy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rytotul/iAmLazy)

> I am too much lazy and also love to experiment with code
or my system. So, the system usually goes wrong and I need to
reinstall it. But after the installing process finishes my job starts.
I always have to customize and install the pachages mannually.
And it takes time from the reserved time for my sleep.

_So, I somehow managed to write the scripts and help me to be lazy_

### Requirements:

* Python 3.5 or above (_'python3 --version'_)
* pip 3 (_'sudo apt install python3-pip && pip3 --version'_)
* LSB Release Info (_'pip3 install lsb_release'_)

### I will make a list and update it as I write a new one or modify.

* Favourite Package Installer (_It will install the packages I like most for my linux distro_)

### Todo:

* Theme Customizer
* Facebook message autoresponder

### Done:

- [x] Favourite Package Installer
