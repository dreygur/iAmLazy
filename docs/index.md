# Help me to be 'Lazy' [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dreygur/iAmLazy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dreygur/iAmLazy)

> I am too much lazy and also love to experiment with code
or my system. So, the system usually goes wrong and I need to
reinstall it. But after the installing process finishes, my job starts.
I always have to customize and install the packages mannually.
And it takes time from the reserved time for my sleep.  
_So, I somehow managed to write the scripts and helped me to be lazy_

### Requirements:

* Python 3.5 or above (_'python3 --version'_)
* pip 3 (_'sudo apt install python3-pip && pip3 --version'_)
* LSB Release Info (_'pip3 install lsb_release'_)
* Patient
* Brain

### I will make a list and update it as I write a new one or modify.

* Favourite Package Installer (_It will install the packages I like most for my linux distro_)

### How-To:
* `python3 Python/Favourite\ Packages\ Installer.py` installs my favourite packages on debian based distro
* `python3 Python/Install\ Themes.py` configures my XFCE4-de as I like to use
* `python3 Python/Config\ vscode\ for\ me.py` installs the plugins I use on my Visual Studio Code
* `bash git.sh` updates my git repo (The script needs to be located in the responsible repo. Current Location: `Bash/git.sh`)
* `bash codebloks-installer.sh` installs Code::Blocks IDE (As I was learning C on windows so it was needed :smile:. Location: `Bash/codebloks-installer.sh`)
* `bash xampp_installer.sh` install the famous XAMPP-Server on debian :smile: (Location: `Bash/xampp_installer.sh`)
* `bash backup.sh` for backing up my installed packages on system (Location: `backup.sh`)
* `./SMS` it has a long story. To compile: `gcc -c SMS.c -o SMS -l curl`

### Todo:

* Facebook message autoresponder
* Write Something in C/C++
* Try to port the python scripts in Bash

### Done:

- [x] Favourite Package Installer
- [x] Theme Customizer

### Language Used:
* Python3
* Bash
* JavaScript
* GoogleScript (JS Ported for Google Suite)
* Batch (Microsoft tries to port everything they find)
* C (A little)
* C++ (Will be added)
* PHP7 (Will be added)

That's all... :relaxed:
